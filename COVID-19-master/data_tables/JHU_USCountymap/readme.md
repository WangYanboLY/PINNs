- Confirmed cases include presumptive positive cases.
- Recovered cases are estimates based on local media reports, and may be substantially lower than the true number. 
- Active cases = total confirmed - total recovered - total deaths. 
- The names of locations included on the Website correspond with the official designations used by the U.S. Department of State.
- All cases of COVID-19 in repatriated US citizens from the Diamond Princess are grouped together. These individuals have been assigned to various quarantine locations (in military bases and hospitals) around the US. This grouping is consistent with the CDC.
