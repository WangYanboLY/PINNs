# Standardization Process

In order to create a dataset where the demographic categories are comparable between states, we need to follow an standardization process that in some cases involve making assumptions. This process is detailed below.


### For each State:
---
1. Unify naming conventions
    - Unify naming of unknowns by renaming categories that represent unknowns. (i.e. `not_reported`, `not_available`, `missing`, etc.)
    - Create a consistent naming convention for demographic categories
        - Separate mixed categories with a hyphen (-)
        - Set all data to lower case
        - Unify differently named categories that represent the same group. (i.e. change `hispanic_or_latino` to `hispanic_latino`)
        - Generalize specific racial groups to broader categories (i.e. change `filipino` to `asian`)
        - Decisions on how to rename and recategorize race and ethnicity groups based on guidance from [Office of Management and Budget Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-23672/standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and-presenting-federal-data-on-race-and-ethnicity)
---
2. Filter data to only contain `Estimate_type` equal to `total_cumulative` or `rate_percent`, which are the most informative estimates when it comes to compare incidence and disparities across states. 
---
3. Aggregate mixed categories when possible (for example, age & sex/gender to obtain age on one side, and sex/gender on the other)
    - Check each component of the mixed category. If the state does not already have that component as a separate data point and if the mixed catgegory can effectively split, then the new category can be aggregated. Check this for each date.
    - This is done for the following mixed categories:
        - `race_ethnicity`
        - `race_age`
        - `ethnicity_age`
        - `gender_sex_race`
        - `age_gender_sex`
---
4.  Drop mixed categories where a state already has each component, with the exception or `race_ethnicity`. For example, if a state provides `age` and `gender_sex`, then `age_gender_sex` would be dropped.
---
5. Convert the existing age ranges to standardized ranges: 
    - Assume uniform distribution across existing age ranges and assume the max age is `100`
    - Divide the value in the existing age range by the number of years in it, and assign each individual age that dividend. Add an exception for vaccines, ages below 5 are assigned a value of `0`. 
    - Group the ages together by the desiered age ranges using the sum of the group to get the standardized age. 
---
6. Calculate rate_percent where missing or if we determine it needs to be recalculated
    - If a state only provides `total_cumulative` for a certain demographic category, then `rate_percent` is derived for each new row using the `total_cumulative` values. 
    - If we determine that a state's provided `rate_percent` data is incorrect, and `total_cumulative` values are available, then replace them with calculated values.
